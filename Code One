Sleep, that illicit, unstructured anarchy, finally claimed him. The Sun, that vulgar, insistent eye, was already at its zenith when he was jerked into the abrasive present. For a moment, he was mere protoplasm, blinking with the slow, muddy wonder of a creature newly emerged from the primordial ooze—a pure, owlish incomprehension of the synthetic world. Then, the full, sickening weight of memory, the unpardonable past, crashed upon him: \"Oh, my God, my God!\"\nThe blasphemy was a gasp, and he pressed a shaking palm to an eyelid, as if to blind himself to the unbearable clarity of the present moment.</p> That selfsame evening, the synthetic frenzy was re-ignited. The air thickened with the persistent, mechanical hum of the swarm of Drones and the predatory jostle of the News-Reporters. The previous night's indiscretion—the full, unhygienic spectacle of the Metaverse Orgy—was now, predictably, the day's indispensable, mass-produced scandal. \"Savage!\" chirped the leading edge of the advance, the brightly coloured, hyper-aggressive scouts from the New York Times, \"Mr. Savage!\" Only the immense, indifferent silence of the moor answered. The ingress was inevitable. The door of the archaic Broadcasting House yielded to their curiosity. They spilled into the sterile, geometric confinement of a room best described as living quarters, then through an archway to a second. A half-closed door beckoned. <p>\"Mr. Savage!\" The ritualistic call. They pushed it wide. The image was instantaneous, shocking in its definitive, unedited finality: a body, a partial, dreadful excision of the face, a shotgun still warm with the sudden cessation of history. And then, with the practiced, disciplined reflex of those who understand the value of a clean, publishable narrative, they retreated, leaving the untidy truth behind.</p>",
